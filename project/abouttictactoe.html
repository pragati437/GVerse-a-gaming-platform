        <h2>Tic Tac Toe is a simple two-player game played on a 3x3 grid. Here's how it works:</h2>
        <br><br>

<b>1. Setup:</b>The game begins with an empty 3x3 grid.
<br><br>
<b>2. Player Turns:</b> Players take turns marking an empty cell in the grid. One player is assigned "X," and the other "O."
<br><br>
<b>3. Objective:</b> The goal is to create a row, column, or diagonal of your symbol (X or O). The first player to achieve this wins.
<br><br>
<b>4. Gameplay:</b> Players alternate turns placing their symbol in an empty cell. The game continues until one player wins or the grid is filled without a winner (resulting in a draw).
<br><br>
<b>5. Winning Conditions:</b> A player wins if they have three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal. If the grid is filled without any winning combination, the game is a draw.
<br><br>
<b>6. End Game:</b> When a player wins or the game ends in a draw, the result is displayed, and players may choose to play again.
<br><br>
Tic Tac Toe's simplicity and finite possibilities make it a popular game for learning basic strategies and logic. The key challenge is in foreseeing and blocking your opponent's moves while aiming to create your winning pattern.
