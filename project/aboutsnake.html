        <h2>The Snake Game is a classic game where a player controls a snake that moves around a bounded area, aiming to eat food pellets while avoiding collisions with itself or the boundaries. Here's how it typically works:</h2>
        <br><br>
1. <b>Initialization:</b> The game starts with a snake (usually a single unit) and a piece of food within a defined area.
<br><br>
2. <b>Movement:</b> The snake moves continuously in the direction it's facing. The player can change its direction using arrow keys or other controls.
<br><br>
3. <b>Eating: </b>When the snake's head touches a food pellet, it "eats" it, making the snake longer. This increases the score.
<br><br>
4. <b>Collision:</b> If the snake collides with itself or the boundaries of the game area, the game ends.
<br><br>
5. <b>Speed Increase:</b> As the game progresses or the snake grows longer, the game might speed up to increase difficulty.
<br><br>
6. <b>Scoring:</b> Typically, the score increases with each food pellet eaten.
<br><br>
7. <b>End Game:</b> The game ends when the snake collides, and the final score is displayed.
<br><br>
This basic structure forms the core of most snake games. Variations may include power-ups, different levels, or additional obstacles to make the game more challenging and engaging.
